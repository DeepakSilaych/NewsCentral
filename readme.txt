- this website is created using mainly HTML and CSS. 
- For some icon purpose, fontawesome.com
- little bit of js is used:
	1. Navigation bar
	2. GoToTOP Button
	3. Preloader
- for all the major and minor styling work, only css is used. No library and frameworks are used


ps: i mistakenly overwritten/replaced all my css files(except template.css) with blank file few hrs before submission :<
